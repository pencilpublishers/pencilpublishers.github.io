<h3>The freaks they are a changin'</h3>
<pre>
Pirate with the eye-patch black and weapons held in hands,
Will you hold up a ship or dig treasure in far lands?
The ships are gone; people now use aeroplanes by throngs,
We’ve found all the treasure, so we now pirate films and songs.

Frankenstein with body blue, and limbs all sewn together,
Do you go to towns and run people under the weather?
People have phones, they won’t look up; so I can’t frighten the critter,
But I’ve learned to move with the times- I’m now on twittter!

Mummy, the body of whose pharaoh you have saved,
Will you go back to your land for those who dug your grave?
My pyramids are filled with tourists who defile our dead,
So I've now cursed boringness on my museum instead.
