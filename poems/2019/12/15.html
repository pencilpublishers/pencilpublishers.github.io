<h3>Drunk Dickens</h3>
<pre>
This character's name is Christopher Macktorey,
He's an orphan and he works in a factory.
His parents died when he was barely two,
Noe he's best friends with an overgrown shrew.
He's starved at the factory; he runs away.
He lives on the streets and then he's made prey
By a nasty old German who gives him drugs,
Turns him to a louse and makes him live with bugs.
But he becomes famous, his story is seen.
He invited for tea by the Queen.
Now just how he does that, I'll have to think.
