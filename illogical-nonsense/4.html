<h3>Warning:</h3>
<i>This book has been made purely for fun, and for the purpose of mocking logic. It has gone through a rigorous checking process to make sure that it does not comply with any true facts.
These rules can not be followed. If you go by the rules, you will fail your academics, and amount to nothing in life. Some rules may even pose a risk to your sanity. If they don't, the terrible
illustrations certainly will. We the authors of this book already serve this position.</i>

You've probably heard that you have to put 'an' before a noun starting with a vovel. But 'an' starts with a vovel.If you are going to say:<br><img src="rule4.jpg" width=200 height=100><br>, one 
must put an 'an' before the first an, and another and another, and so on, thereby never reaching the 'idiot'. Same goes for 'a': put an 'an' before the 'a' and another one and so on.<br>
