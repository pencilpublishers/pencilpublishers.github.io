<i>This book has been made purely for fun, and for the purpose of mocking logic. It has gone through a rigorous checking process to make sure that it does not comply with any true facts.
 These rules can not be followed. If you go by the rules, you will fail your academics, and amount to nothing in life. Some rules may even pose a risk to your sanity.

Now, we know of these so-called 'prime numbers'. They're supposed have only 2 factors; 1 and themselves. THEY DON’T EXIST. Yes, this fact will come as a shock to many mathematicians who have
devoted their life to the research of these numbers, but it's true. 1 isn’t a prime number, because its factors -- one and itself, are the same.  So it is a non-prime number.
 But 1 itself is a factor of 'prime numbers'. And if a number has a non-prime factor, it is automatically disqualified as a prime number. Therefore, the whole notion of prime numbers is dead.
